# testing

This repository contains an API skeleton where you can add your code,
choose the language of your preference.

## Application Overview

You need to complete a functionality in our API that provides some help to
the networking team.

The API has 3 missing endpoints, the first endpoint converts Subnet Mast to
CIDR format, the second endpoint return the CIDR value of a given Subnet Mask
and finally the third endpoint simply validates an IPv4.

e.g.

```
curl localhost/cidr-to-mask?value=24
{
  "function": "cidrToMask",
  "input": "24",
  "output": "255.255.255.0"
}
```

```
curl localhost/mask-to-cidr?value=255.255.0.0
{
  "function": "maskToCidr",
  "input": "255.255.0.0",
  "output": "16"
}

```

```
curl localhost/ip-validation?value=255.255.0.0
{
  "function": "ipv4Validation",
  "input": "255.255.0.0",
  "output": true
}

```


## Task

### Coding
  * Complete the following endpoints.
   - `/mask-to-cidr?value=<VALUE>`
   - `/cidr-to-mask?value=<VALUE>`
   - `/ip-validation?value=<VALUE>`
  * Make sure your tests are passing
  * Add missing tests
  * You should pick one from a list of available languages.
    - [Python]
    - [Java]
